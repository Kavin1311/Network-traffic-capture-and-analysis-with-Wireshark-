# Network-traffic-capture-and-analysis-with-Wireshark
## AIM:
To capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark in order to observe protocols, packets, and potential anomalies.

## DESIGN STEPS:
### Step 1:
Install Wireshark using the command:

### Step 2:
Launch Wireshark and select the appropriate network interface for live traffic capture.

### Step 3:
Start the capture, apply filters (like http, tcp, ip.addr == x.x.x.x) to analyze specific traffic, and stop the capture after observing relevant data.

## PROCEDURE:
Open Wireshark and Select a Network Interface • Launch Wireshark. • Select an active interface (like Wi-Fi or Ethernet) to start capturing packets.<br/>

Start Capturing Packets • Click the blue shark fin icon or double-click the interface. • Wireshark will start capturing all real-time traffic.<br/>

Apply Filters to Focus on Specific Traffic • Use filters like http, ip.addr == 192.168.1.1, or tcp.port == 80 in the top filter bar to narrow down results.<br/>

Analyze Packet Details • Click on a packet to view its detailed breakdown including frame, Ethernet, IP, TCP/UDP layers, and data payload.<br/>

Export or Save the Capture • Go to File > Save As to store the capture in .pcap format for future analysis.<br/>

## OUTPUT:
# Open Wireshark and Select a Network Interface
